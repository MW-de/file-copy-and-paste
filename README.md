**File Copy And Paste** is a simple HTML page that enables **copying files as base64 strings** and **pasting base64 strings into file downloads**.

Use it when a file needs to be transferred from one place to another and all you have is **clipboard sharing and web browsers** on both ends.

Tested in Chrome and Firefox. Written in vanilla Javascript. File sizes of 50+ MB possible.
